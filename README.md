# Taxi-data-project
Scenario:
A company based in New York wants to optimize the number of its taxis waiting at JFK international airport. The airport is located quite a distance from the main business area Manhattan. This means that it takes a long time for taxis waiting there to be available in other areas. On the other hand, customers arriving at the airport are take much longer journeys, and are more lucrative. How many taxis should the company keep waiting at JFK airport?
